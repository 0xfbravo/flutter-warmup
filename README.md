### Description

Using [OpenWeather's APIs](https://openweathermap.org/api), I developed a basic application using Cubit and Clean Architecture.

To use it, you should copy the `.example.env` and rename it to `.env`

Into the `.env` file, look for the key `OPEN_WEATHER_API_TOKEN` and fill it with your own OpenWeather's API token.

e.g:

```bash
OPEN_WEATHER_API_TOKEN=HERE_GOES_YOUR_TOKEN
```
